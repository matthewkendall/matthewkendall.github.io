## About
I am an undergraduate at Princeton University majoring in math.

Here is my <a href="matthewkendall.github.io/assets/Kendall_CV_22.pdf" target="_blank"> CV</a>.

## Projects and Research
- Quantitative Helly-type theorems via sparse approximation <br> (with Gergely Ambrus and Victor Hugo Almendra-Hern√°ndez)  <br> https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05745 

-   An [expository paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NS0GOi4oB5l6gTXtjJSKy62yDzaEBiTY/view?usp=sharing) on the proof of Steinitz' Theorem, classifying the graphs of polyhedra
  
-   Slides for a reading project on finite-dimensional representations of finite groups, Lie groups, and Lie algebras: [representations of $S_d$](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QjwRF0HZF1aFF6zScaClb6YVIeXvHXng/view?usp=sharing) , [Grassmannians and representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i7wDhTK4fKgiomRHZBb_MVMKBFfjago0/view?usp=sharing), [analysis on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the Peter-Weyl theorem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hi3LycRgXJi-u_KKOjKsU4CNl5S-YvmY/view?usp=sharing)
