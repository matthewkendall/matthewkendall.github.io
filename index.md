## Mathematical writing
Everything below is expository.
For research, please take a look at the CV.
If you find a mistake or are interested in something that is written here, please don't hesitate to email me.

- <a href="/assets/simultaneously-diagonalizable.pdf" target="_blank"> Simultaneously diagonalizable operators exercise</a>. One of my favorite linear algebra exercises.
- <a href="/assets/thesis-printable.pdf" target="_blank"> The surgery exact triangle in Heegaard Floer homology</a>. My undergraduate thesis is an expository account of Heegaard Floer homology and a proof of a key computational tool in the theory, the surgery exact triangle. Heegaard Floer homology is a package of invariants for closed and oriented three-manifolds, defined by Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó. Roughly half of the thesis constructs Heegaard Floer homology and the other half proves the surgery exact triangle. The intention is to make this thesis readable for anybody who is familiar with algebraic topology up to Poincaré duality and differential geometry up to geodesics and connections on manifolds. 
- <a href="/assets/HM-HF.pdf" target="_blank"> On Morse-Smale and Lagrangian Floer homology</a>. A brief account and comparison of Morse homology and Lagrangian Floer homology.
- <a href="/assets/steinitz.pdf" target="_blank"> The proof of Steinitz's Theorem</a>. A proof of a characterization of graphs of polyhedra.
